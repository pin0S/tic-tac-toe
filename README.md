# Tic-tac-toe
---
This is a simple implementation of tic-tac-toe made during my bootcamp. 

The aim was to practice methods, loops and conditions statements by creating a tic-tac-toe game for two human players.

To make this challenge harder I added a computer a single player can play against. I also added the ability to choose whether the player wanted to be noughts ('o') or crosses ('x'), which also determines the order of player. 

## TODO
* Output if the player who won was the computer or player
* Take in a players name and refer to them as the player
* Store players results in a list that they can refer to in the future
* refactor
